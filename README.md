# Background
Scrapeify initially started as a java-only program which utilized the Spotify API in order to grab a playlist link and output every song on the playlist including the artist(s). By sorting and organizing these names into a list we were able to use Jsoup to webscrape the website Metacritic.com in order to find a numerical rating for a song. The program would then average those ratings and produce a final rating for one's playlist. Scrapeify is an extension to this project coded in Android Studio to make the project usable on Android devices. There are also many more features such as an updated UI, the ability to find similar songs, and even converting the playlist into corresponding Youtube links.

# Learning Objectives
This project was an attempt to learn and familiarize ourselves with the use of APIs and actually putting the coding we learned into practicality. Furthermore, this project helped develop proficiency in Android Studio and real world application of the programming language Java. 

# Future Objectives
Although the project was a major success for the time span we completed it in, there were features that we could not implement with our current skills. Such features included a spotify to youtube playlist converter, which needed the help of the youtube API. As for future goals, I hope to expand this project into a fully fledged app on the play store and to optimize the runtimes of the app.
